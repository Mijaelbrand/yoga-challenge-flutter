# iOS Testing Guide for Yoga Challenge Flutter App

## üß™ Testing Strategy

Since your Android app is already deployed on Firebase for beta testing, we'll focus on ensuring the iOS version works perfectly before deployment. This guide covers all aspects of iOS testing.

## üì± Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- macOS with Xcode 14+ installed
- iOS Simulator or physical iOS device
- Flutter SDK installed
- CocoaPods installed

### Setup Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Install iOS dependencies
cd ios
pod install
cd ..

# Check available devices
flutter devices
```

## üîç Testing Categories

### 1. Unit Testing
Test individual components and functions:

```bash
# Run unit tests
flutter test

# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

### 2. Widget Testing
Test UI components:

```bash
# Run widget tests
flutter test test/widget_test.dart

# Run specific widget tests
flutter test test/dashboard_screen_test.dart
```

### 3. Integration Testing
Test complete user flows:

```bash
# Run integration tests
flutter test integration_test/
```

### 4. iOS-Specific Testing

#### A. Simulator Testing
```bash
# Run on iOS Simulator
flutter run -d ios

# Run on specific simulator
flutter run -d "iPhone 15 Pro"
```

#### B. Physical Device Testing
```bash
# Run on connected iPhone/iPad
flutter run -d ios

# Build for device
flutter build ios --release
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Testing Tools

### 1. Flutter Inspector
```bash
# Launch Flutter Inspector
flutter run -d ios --debug
```
Then open Flutter Inspector in your IDE.

### 2. Performance Testing
```bash
# Run performance tests
flutter run -d ios --profile

# Check performance metrics
flutter run -d ios --trace-startup
```

### 3. Memory Testing
```bash
# Check memory usage
flutter run -d ios --profile
```
Monitor memory usage in Xcode Instruments.

### 4. Network Testing
```bash
# Test with network conditions
flutter run -d ios --debug
```
Use Network Link Conditioner in iOS Simulator.

## üìä Test Automation

### 1. GitHub Actions (Already Configured)
The `.github/workflows/ios_build.yml` file will:
- Build iOS app on every push
- Run tests automatically
- Generate test reports
- Upload build artifacts

### 2. Codemagic (Already Configured)
The `codemagic.yaml` file will:
- Build iOS app
- Run tests
- Deploy to TestFlight
- Send notifications

### 3. Local Test Scripts
Create test scripts for common scenarios:

```bash
# test_ios.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running iOS tests..."

# Clean build
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Install iOS dependencies
cd ios
pod install
cd ..

# Run tests
flutter test

# Build iOS
flutter build ios --release

echo "iOS tests completed!"
```

## üêõ Debugging iOS Issues

### Common iOS Issues & Solutions

#### 1. Build Errors
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
flutter run -d ios
```

#### 2. CocoaPods Issues
```bash
# Update CocoaPods
sudo gem install cocoapods
pod repo update

# Reinstall pods
cd ios
pod deintegrate
pod install
cd ..
```

#### 3. Permission Issues
- Check `ios/Runner/Info.plist` for required permissions
- Ensure permission descriptions are clear
- Test permission requests on device

#### 4. Network Issues
- Check App Transport Security settings
- Verify API endpoints work on iOS
- Test with different network conditions

#### 5. UI Issues
- Test on different iOS versions
- Test on different device sizes
- Check for iOS-specific UI elements
