# iOS Testing Quick Start Guide

## ðŸš€ Get Started in 5 Minutes

Since your Android app is already deployed on Firebase for beta testing, let's focus on getting your iOS version ready for testing.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites Check

### 1. Install Flutter (if not already installed)
```bash
# Download Flutter SDK from: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows
# Extract to C:\flutter
# Add C:\flutter\bin to your PATH
```

### 2. Install Xcode (for iOS development)
- **Option A**: Install on Mac (recommended)
- **Option B**: Use cloud services (GitHub Actions, Codemagic)

### 3. Install CocoaPods (on Mac)
```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

## ðŸ§ª Quick Testing Setup

### Step 1: Setup Project
```bash
cd yoga_challenge_flutter

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Install iOS dependencies
cd ios
pod install
cd ..

# Generate code
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
```

### Step 2: Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

### Step 3: Test on iOS Simulator
```bash
# Check available devices
flutter devices

# Run on iOS Simulator
flutter run -d ios
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Essential Testing Commands

### Basic Testing
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d ios

# Run tests
flutter test

# Analyze code
flutter analyze
```

### iOS-Specific Testing
```bash
# Build for iOS device
flutter build ios --release

# Build for TestFlight
flutter build ipa --release

# Performance testing
flutter run -d ios --profile
```

## ðŸ“± Testing Options

### Option 1: Local Mac Development
1. Install Xcode on Mac
2. Install CocoaPods
3. Run `flutter run -d ios`
4. Test on iOS Simulator and physical device

### Option 2: Cloud-Based Testing
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Use GitHub Actions (already configured)
3. Get automated builds and test results
4. Use Codemagic for TestFlight deployment

### Option 3: Test on Android First
1. Test core functionality on Android
2. Use Flutter Web for UI testing
3. Then proceed with iOS testing

## ðŸ”§ Automated Testing Scripts

### Windows (PowerShell)
```bash
# Run the automated testing script
.\test_ios.bat
```

### macOS/Linux
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x test_ios.sh

# Run the automated testing script
./test_ios.sh
```
